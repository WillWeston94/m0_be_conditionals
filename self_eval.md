# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

    A small way a conditional can be useful in our code is when we are looking for user input and validation.

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

    I dont think I would do anything different if I could do the assignment over again. I actually learned quite a bit from the way I accomplished the assignment and utilized git properly. 

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

    I was brought satisfaction today from my way of thinking and how I solved the Mild coding challenge because it led me to being able to solve the Spicy challenge instantly as I only had to change a few variables and statements because the foundation for the solution was already apart of my edited Mild solution.
